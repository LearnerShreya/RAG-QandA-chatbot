Loan Approval – Practical Insights and Field Notes

Approval Timeframes
Salaried individuals with simple documents can get approval in 3 to 5 working days.
Self-employed applicants may take 7 to 14 days, depending on business documentation.
Under-construction properties often take longer due to technical stage evaluations.

Approval vs Pre-Approval
Pre-approval is based only on income and credit score and does not guarantee the loan.
Final approval is granted after property legal checks and full document verification.

FOIR – Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio
FOIR is calculated as total EMIs divided by net monthly income.
For salaried applicants, ideal FOIR should be under 40 percent.
For self-employed, up to 50 percent may be acceptable.

Common Red Flags During Loan Approval
Frequent job changes in the last 12 months.
Pending personal loans or credit card dues.
Co-applicant with poor repayment history.
Property with unclear land records or missing approvals.

Ways to Improve Approval Chances
Add a co-applicant with stable income.
Increase tenure to reduce monthly EMI burden.
Close smaller loans before applying.
Correct errors in credit report and raise score to above 750.

Documents Often Missed in Application
